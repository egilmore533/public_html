			<p>PROJECT PROBLEM</p>
		</body>
			
			
		<body>
			There are many animals and plants that someone could find in the outdoors. 
			So many that it's hard to find out which ones are potentially dangerous. 
			With time someone could learn which ones are which, but in the early stages 
			of outdoorsman ship it could be overwhelming. A great tool could be a single 
			source that could: help identify which plants and animals are dangerous, 
			what about them is dangerous, and how one should handle oneself when they 
			encounter this specimen. Our application helps the user identify there 
			location and the most commonly found plants and animals in their region.

			<p>STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS</p>
		</body>
		
		<body>
			People whom consider themselves outdoorsman such as: hikers, climbers, 
			campers, fisherman, hunters, and survivalists would all be primary 
			stakeholders. Other primary stakeholders would include emergency care 
			facilities. 
			<br>
			Secondary stakeholders would include biologists and zoologists who would have 
			a role in determining which plants and animals should be considered dangerous 
			to humans.
