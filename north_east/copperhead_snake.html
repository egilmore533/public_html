				<p>BITE SYMPTOMS</p>
			</body>
			
			<body>
				Not usually fatal in adults, but very painful and often lasting discomfort

				<p>SAFETY</p>
			</body>
			
			<body>
				Clean up around the yard
				Remove any trash
				Replace any vegative garden mulch with gravel mulch, which will stop the snakes hiding in it.
				Be very careful when lifting any old logs or other trash that no snakes are lurking beneath them, a good pair of thick gloves, boots and thick jeans are a good precaution also
