              <li> Damage can occur to muscle and bone tissue, especially when the bite occurs in the outer extremities areas in which there is not a large muscle mass to absorb the venom. </li>

      </p>
      
      <p> Safety: 
         <ul class="center">
             <li> Clean up around the yard </li>
             <li> Remove any trash </li>
             <li> Replace any vegative garden mulch with gravel mulch, which will stop the snakes hiding in it. </li>
             <li> Be very careful when lifting any old logs or other trash that no snakes are lurking beneath them, a good pair of thick gloves, boots and thick jeans are a good precaution also </li>
